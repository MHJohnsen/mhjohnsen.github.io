Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that most of us breathe in every day through air pollution, and even small amounts of the gas have significant impact on cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular function. Worldwide, the World Health Organisation estimates that 4.2 million deaths per year occur due to air pollution, and we know that carbon monoxide air pollution is linked with increased incidence of vascular diseases, such as stroke and vascular dementia. However, we donâ€™t know precisely how low-level carbon monoxide exposure affects vascular health and contributes to pathophysiology. 

Our research uses both human volunteers, model organisms and laboratory techniques to probe the impact of low-level carbon monoxide exposure on physiological function. 

We use imaging (MRI and ultrasound) to probe the impact of carbon monoxide on vascular function in human volunteers. Using small doses of carbon monoxide, we study blood flow and vascular reactivity, with a particular focus on the cerebral vasculature, nitric oxide synthesis and release, oxidative stress and inflammation. Previous research in the lab has shown a significant impact of carbon monoxide on fMRI signal in healthy humans, at doses a fraction of UK guidelines.

We use a custom-built carbon monoxide exposure chamber to study how carbon monoxide exposure impacts foetal development in a model organism. Our work is focused on cardiovascular congenital defects, looking at changes in cardiac morphology as well as impact on select cellular pathways. Using this exposure chamber, we are also working with Dr Prachi Stafford to investigate cell monolayer and 3D tissue function.
