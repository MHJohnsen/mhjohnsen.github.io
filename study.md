I am keen to hear from prospective PhD students or research students interested in physiology, neuroscience and/or vascular disease, or with an interest in air pollution and carbon monoxide. Please email me if you are interested in a topic related to our <a href="/research">research</a>. 

NEWS: we have a new PhD position open (funded) at the moment, in collaboration with the University of Hertfordshire - ad will be released shortly
