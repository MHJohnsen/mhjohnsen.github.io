## Current members
Lucie Wilson in our group is a PhD student working on the effect of CO on the human brain, using techniques such as MRI and transcranial Doppler ultrasound. She started her PhD in February 2021. 

MSc students in the lab are working on the impact of CO in oral/lung cells and changes in atmospheric/ambient levels of CO in the UK.

We take on BSc students working on their final year projects. Projects have included investigating the impact of carbon monoxide on an avian model of development, developing an exposure chamber for carbon monoxide exposure of tissues and cells, analysing the impact of carbon monoxide on reaction time, autonomic control and cognitive processing, assessing CO variation in ambient air, and studying the effect of carbon monoxide on markers of cerebrovascular disease in a population of smokers (the latter in collaboration with Oxford Brookes University).

## Collaborations
We work with the Moosavi lab at Oxford Brookes University on cardio-, cerebrovascular and behavioural impact of cigarette and e-cigarette smoking, and with the Robbins lab at the University of Oxford on respiratory correlates of the same. We also collaborate with researchers at The University of Sheffield on the impact of carbon monoxide on cardiac development, with Simon Clarke (Aintree Hospital) on improving accuracy of CO measurements in exhaled gases, with Prof Robert Chilcott (University of Hertfordshire) and a joint PhD student, Sean England, on alternative techniques for measuring low-level CO exposure and its effect on the brain, and with <a href="https://www.shu.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/staff-profiles/prachi-stafford">Dr Prachi Stafford</a> at Sheffield Hallam University to develop techniques for looking at carbon monoxide impact in cell monolayers and tissues. Collaborations with colleagues in the Biomolecular Research Centre (<a href="https://www.shu.ac.uk/research/specialisms/biomolecular-sciences-research-centre">BMRC</a>) at Sheffield Hallam University are initiated on select smaller projects to use the above techniques in a range of experimental paradigms.

## Past PhD students
Emmanuel Debrah worked on cerebral mechanisms of breathlessness and its reliefs, with a particular focus on the role of the insula. He completed his PhD in Clinical Respiratory Physiology at Oxford Brookes University in 2016.

Anja Hayen worked on identifying brain mechanisms of dyspnoea in healthy volunteer models using functional magnetic resonance imaging. She completed her DPhil in Neuroscience at the University of Oxford in 2014.
