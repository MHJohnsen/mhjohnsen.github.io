I write books. To be specific, I have written two and published none (yet). My writing blends horror and dark fantasy with elements of mystery, sci-fi, folklore and mythology. 	While fond of anti-heroes, I find nothing beats a good anti-villain and I love stories with a vicious streak. 

I grew up in western Norway with its rough weather and cold seas, and spent my holidays in my mother's childhood home in the arctic north. This has influenced my forays into horror. Having lived in Oxford since 2003, I recently relocated to Sheffield - the Steel City - where I enjoy my day job as a scientist. M.H.Johnsen is a pseudonym to keep the creative and science writing apart. So far, I have completed two novels, am working on two more, and have published in the Journal of Imaginary Research (2017, 2018 and 2019)
